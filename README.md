# Q-curves
Code to accompany the paper "Q-curves and the Lebesgueâ€“Nagell equation" by Michael A. Bennett, Philippe Michaud-Jacobs, and Samir Siksek, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09219.

The file MainCode.m contains all the computations and verifications.

The file Elimination_outputs.txt contains the output of the elimination step in the MainCode.m file.

The file ThueMahlerSolver.m (written by A. Gherga and S. Siksek) contains code to solve Thue-Mahler equations.

The code to accompany the (now outdated) first version of the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09219v1) is available at the v1-code branch: https://github.com/michaud-jacobs/Q-curves/tree/v1-code
